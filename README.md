# Archived Thoughts - 2012

All the thoughts published on [The Pastry Box Project](http://the-pastry-box-project.net) are also stored on GitHub.

This approach is part of our [content preservation philosophy](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/philosophy).

This repository collects the thoughts published in 2012 (starting at #1).

You'll notice that the template used for the thoughts stored on GitHub is not an exact replica of the template used on the website. Javascript has been removed and CSS has been simplified.

You will find the following directories in this repo:

 * **bakers:** The thoughts are organized by bakers. Example: "rebecca-murphey/2013-november-18"
 * **stream:** The thoughts are published in a "stream" fashion (one after the other, in order of appearance on the website). Each thought is prefixed with an index. Example: "1-ethan-marcotte-2012-january-1"
 * **date:** The thoughts are organized by years/months/days/bakers. Example: "2013/march/30/brian-suda"

Enjoy.
